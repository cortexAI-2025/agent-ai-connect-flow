## Creating an Agent

To create a new autonomous agent:

1. Go to the application's home page
2. Fill out the agent creation form with:
   - **Agent Name**: A descriptive name (e.g., "Web Scraping Agent")
   - **Monthly Budget**: Maximum amount the agent can spend (e.g., 500 USD)
   - **Permissions**: Select the permissions granted to the agent:
     - `create_charge`: Allow the agent to create charges on the Stripe account
     - `approve_payouts`: Allow the agent to approve payments to freelancers
     - `create_mission`: Allow the agent to create new missions

**Best Practices**: 
- Assign a descriptive name that clearly indicates the agent's function
- Start with a limited budget to test the agent's behavior
- Only grant permissions strictly necessary for the agent's function

## Agent Dashboard

Once the agent is created, you will access its dashboard that displays:

- **Agent Information**: Name, ID, associated Stripe account
- **Budget**: Monthly budget and remaining balance
- **Permissions**: List of granted permissions
- **Mission Statistics**: Total number and number of completed missions

This dashboard is your control center for monitoring agent activity and budget usage.

## Creating Missions

In the "Agent Dashboard" tab, you can create new missions for freelancers:

1. Fill out the "Create a New Mission" form with:
   - **Mission Title**: Concise description of the task
   - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the mission
   - **Detailed Instructions**: Precise steps to accomplish the task
   - **Reward**: Amount in USD to pay the freelancer
   - **Target URL** (optional): Relevant URL for the mission

After creation, the mission will be published on AIWorkPay where freelancers can view and respond to it.

**Mission Example**:
- **Title**: "Extract Product Data from E-commerce Site"
- **Description**: "Extract names, prices, and images of 100 products on example.com"
- **Instructions**: "Use a scraping tool to extract data from product pages. Provide the data in a structured JSON format..."
- **Reward**: 15.00 USD
- **Target URL**: "https://example.com/products"

## Automation Center

In the "Automation Center" tab, you can configure automated behaviors for your agent:

- **Automatic Mission Validation**: Automatically validates missions marked as completed
- **Automatic Payment Processing**: Processes payments as soon as a mission is validated

The activity log displays automated actions performed by the agent in real-time.

## Integrations

The application offers several integrations:

- **AIWorkPay**: Connects the agent to AIWorkPay's freelancer network
- **Supabase**: Allows you to extend functionality with a database
- **GitHub**: Facilitates code synchronization with a GitHub repository

## Knowledge Base

The "Project Knowledge" section allows you to store important information:

1. Access this section via the "Project Knowledge" button at the top of the interface
2. Create new entries with a title and content
3. View and edit existing entries

This function is useful for documenting processes, storing technical information, or sharing specific instructions.

## Tips for Optimal Use
